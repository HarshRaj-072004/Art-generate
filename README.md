Neural Style Transfer

Created by: Harsh Raj

📚 Project Description

This project implements an artistic style transfer algorithm that blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another. Inspired by the groundbreaking paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by Gatys et al., this project leverages a VGG19 pre-trained model to achieve high-quality results.

🚀 Key Features

🎨 Artistic Style Transfer: Combine content and style images seamlessly.

🖥️ Interactive Command-Line Interface: User-friendly input prompts.

📊 Real-Time Progress Tracking: Monitor optimization updates.

🛠️ Custom Loss Function: Fine-tuned for balanced style-content representation.

📷 Support for Multiple Image Formats: Works with PNG, JPG, and JPEG.

📊 Side-by-Side Comparison: Visualize content, style, and generated images together.

🛠️ Technologies Used

-Python

-TensorFlow

-Keras (VGG19 Pre-trained Model)

-NumPy

-Pillow (PIL)

-Matplotlib

📸 How to Use

-Provide paths to your content image and style image.

-Specify the target image size (default: 256x256).

-Choose an output filename.

-Sit back and let the magic happen!
